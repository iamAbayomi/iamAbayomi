### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Software Developer currently building web applications in Vuejs and Nodejs. 
I worked early in my career as an android developer at Cuesoft where I built Apparule, an android application. 
I got the opportunity to design a courier application at Cellcore as User Interface and Experience Designer.
I completed my Undergraduate Internship at UKConcepts Limited where I built android applications. I also started a company to build productivity applications.
<br>
<br>
My interest in product development made me take courses on product management which I have certificates for. This made me reflect on the various aspects of software development from mobile development on the android platform to designing interfaces for web and mobile devices. 
I am currently studying computer science at the University of Ibadan where I am learning systems programming, database management, computer organization and structure.
